## Implementation Guidance

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Scaffold Structure** (Day 1)

   - Create `src/app/marketplace/[id]/page.tsx`
   - Create subcomponent directory `src/app/marketplace/[id]/components/`
   - Create type definitions in `src/types/listingDetail.ts`

2. **Build Layout** (Day 2-3)

   - Implement `ListingDetailPage` server component
   - Build responsive CSS Grid layout (desktop + mobile)
   - Create `ListingDetailHeader` breadcrumb component

3. **Implement Sections** (Day 4-5)

   - `CommitmentSummary` with all subcomponents
   - `SellerInfoSection` with trust badge integration
   - `PurchaseCtaSection` with state logic

4. **Add States** (Day 6)

   - Loading: `ListingDetailSkeleton` with pulsing animation
   - Error: `ListingDetailError` with recovery options
   - CTA states: Eligible/Ineligible/Needs Wallet/Unauth

5. **Integration & Testing** (Day 7-8)

   - Connect to `/api/marketplace/listings/[id]` endpoint
   - Test all responsive breakpoints
   - QA accessibility and cross-browser testing

6. **Finalization** (Day 9)
   - Address feedback from design review
   - Get all sign-offs
   - Prepare commit and PR

### TypeScript Support

All component props are fully specified:

- See [COMPONENT_SPECS.md](./COMPONENT_SPECS.md) Section 9 for all interfaces
- Example: `ListingDetailPageProps`, `CommitmentSummaryProps`, `PurchaseCtaProps`
- Includes optional fields, union types, and callback signatures

### CSS Architecture

- **Tailwind First**: Use utility classes for 90% of styling
- **CSS Modules**: Only for complex layouts (main grid, sticky positioning)
- **Breakpoints**: `sm:` (640px), `md:` (768px), `lg:` (1024px), `xl:` (1440px)
- **No Custom CSS**: Except for animations and layout that Tailwind doesn't handle

### Mobile-First Approach

1. Start with mobile CSS (375px base)
2. Add media queries for larger screens
3. Test at: 375px, 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
4. Ensure no horizontal scroll at any viewport

### Sign-Off Gates

All 5 gates must pass before shipping:

1. ✅ **Design & Layout**: Matches wireframes, consistent with design system
2. ✅ **Functionality**: CTAs clear, trust signals prominent, errors guide recovery
3. ✅ **Responsive**: Mobile usable, tablet optimized, desktop professional
4. ✅ **Accessibility**: Keyboard nav works, screen readers supported, WCAG AA compliant
5. ✅ **Content & Copy**: CTA text clear, helper text informative, tone appropriate

## Known Constraints & Assumptions

### Design Assumptions

- Listing data is available from `/api/marketplace/listings/[id]` endpoint
- Seller reputation data is included or available via separate endpoint
- Attestation history is available (optional; section hidden if no data)
- User authentication status is available (determines CTA state)
- Wallet connection status can be determined

### Browser Support

- Modern browsers: Chrome 120+, Firefox 121+, Safari 17+, Edge 120+
- Mobile: iOS Safari 17+, Android Chrome 120+
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Sticky positioning may fallback to fixed on unsupported browsers

### Design Limitations

- Sidebar collapses to full-width on mobile (no mini sidebar variant)
- Floating CTA button only on mobile if content > 800px
- Max 10 attestation events shown; "Load more" for additional
- Copy-to-clipboard requires Clipboard API; fallback to manual selection

### Data Assumptions

- Amount, yield, duration formatted by backend or component
- Trust level is one of: 'verified', 'reputable', 'unverified'
- Max loss is percentage (0-100); 100% gets special warning
- Health score is 0-100; color-coded by band (green 90+, blue 75+, orange <75)

---

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Trust Before Action**

   - Seller trust signals visible above fold on desktop
   - Trust badge prominently displayed in sidebar
   - Verification details easily accessible

2. **Clear Purchase States**

   - Each CTA state has distinct button color and text
   - Helper text explains reason for each state
   - No accusatory language for ineligible states

3. **Safe External Navigation**

   - All external links clearly marked with icon
   - Descriptive link labels (not generic "click here")
   - Opens in new tab with proper security attributes

4. **Mobile-First Responsiveness**

   - Built mobile layout first, scaled up for desktop
   - Tested at 375px, 768px, 1024px minimum
   - All touch targets ≥ 44px height and width

5. **Accessibility Compliance**
   - WCAG AA minimum; ready for future WCAG AAA
   - Semantic HTML (button, a, section, nav elements)
   - Full keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader announcements via ARIA
